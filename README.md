This is a little application/game that I'm putting together to practice some
path planning, motion planning, and hopefully differential drive concepts I've
been trying to learn.

I have no experience with game development (meaning I don't have any proper
knowledge as to what best practices are for specifically that). The concepts
I'm focusing on include multi-threading / thread-safe operations, path planning,
object-oriented design and the advantages of inheritance and polymorphism, and
differential-drive simulation, as well as simple Java language design because I
realized I don't have anything Java related on my GitHub.
